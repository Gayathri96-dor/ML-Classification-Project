Importing Libraries:

The notebook begins with importing essential libraries such as:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation.

train_test_split for data splitting.

StandardScaler for feature scaling.

RandomForestClassifier for model building.

classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score for evaluation.

SelectKBest, f_classif for feature selection.

load_breast_cancer for loading the breast cancer dataset.

Loading the Dataset:

The dataset being used is the Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn.datasets.

It is loaded into a DataFrame, and the target column is added as target.

The first five rows are displayed to understand the structure of the dataset.

Feature Selection:

All features except the target column are considered as inputs (X), and the target is the output (y).

SelectKBest with f_classif is used to select the top 10 features based on statistical tests.

These selected features are printed out, indicating the most significant ones for prediction.

Train-Test Split and Scaling:

The data is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to standardize the input features, preparing them for the model.

Both training and testing data are transformed, and their shapes are checked to ensure proper scaling.
